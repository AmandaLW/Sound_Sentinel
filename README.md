"# Sound_Sentinel" 

Sound Sentinel will be a video game in a 3D sensory immersive virtual reality environment.  The display mimics a full 3D environment so the user can look around in real time.  Then projectile balls come at the player, and they must use the controllers to deflect the incoming balls.  The balls will have physics properties and can be used to deflect other incoming balls.
